# A WordPress Application from Scratch

A new WordPress project that will progress step by step.

## Getting Started

### Each step is earmarked for a large application. However, it has started from the this repository:

- [Lab: Write your first WordPress app](https://github.com/sanjibsinha/codeschool/tree/main/wp-content/themes/codeschool-theme)

### From then on each development will be known as code-one, code-two, etc. Therefore, if you are interested to learn how a WordPress aplication is being developed from scratch, please read this README file of each progress. I'm also writing each progress at my blog: 

[Progress Manual: Follow each progress](https://sanjibsinha.com/category/php/)

This project is a starting point for a WordPress application.
